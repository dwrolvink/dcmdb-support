# dcmdb-support
This is a vscode extension written to syntax highlight the custom .stid language files I use in the [dcmdb project](https://github.com/dwrolvink/dcmdb).

I created the stid markup to have a tailored way to define the input for my program. This helped to considerable reduce the size of the input file, and to make it more legible. (Also, I didn't want to add yaml support / parsing).
